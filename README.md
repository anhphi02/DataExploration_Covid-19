Data Exploration of Covid 19 Dataset in SQL Server. The project involves tasks such as identifying patterns and trends in the data, finding correlations between variables, and summarizing the data using basic and intermediate SQL queries that I have learnt

In this SQL project, I explored COVID-19 data using a relational database management system. I started by importing the data into the MS SQL database and then performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the data was in a usable format.

Next, I designed and executed SQL queries to gain insights into the data. I analyzed COVID-19 cases and deaths by country, region, and date range, and calculated key metrics such as case fatality rates and growth rates. I also explored correlations between COVID-19 cases and other factors such as population density and GDP.

To visualize the data, I used Tableau to create interactive dashboards and charts. These visualizations provide a clear picture of the trends and patterns in the data, helping to inform decision-making and policy development related to COVID-19.

Overall, this project demonstrates the power of SQL and data analysis in understanding complex real-world problems and showcases my skills in database management, data cleaning, SQL querying, and data visualization.
